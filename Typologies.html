                The base for Typologies is found in Ancient Greece. Hippocrates, also widely known for his important contribution to modern medicine, built the trivial basis for Typologies with his Hypothesis widely known as Humor Theory.

                Hippocrates attempts to classify human behavior and personality into different types and meanwhile it‚Äôs been debunked, it still plays a big role and has inspired modern Typologies like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), Enneagram, and Big 5.
                The theory suggests that the most important bodily fluids (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) and how they are divided determine how you are as a person.

            <p>Nowadays when people are referring to Typology, they are talking about subparts like Enneagram, MBTI, Big 5, and Temperaments, ‚Ä¶ Their purpose lies in trying to simplify complex human behaviors by identifying patterns and tendencies, providing tools for self-understanding, interpersonal relationships, and personal growth. </p>
            <p class="paragraph">tag.</p>
            <p class="bold-text">It is important to mention that these systems are highly criticized by Psychologists and are considered Pseudosociology since they consist of unproven hypotheses.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">tag.</p>
            <p>Despite this the Typology community has been growing significantly over the years. Due to this there is a lot of misconception and misinformation about the different subparts. Especially MBTI has suffered from being oversimplified and mischaracterized which has led to many mistypings. Thus studying typologies has become a lot more complicated because of all of the misinformation around the internet.</p>
