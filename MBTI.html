        <p class="quote">Premise 1: This person is crying, Premise 2: Soothing a person requires emotional intelligence, Premise 3: I struggle with that, Premise 4: This person hates not being soothed, Premise 5: I would like to retain a friendship with this person ‚Üí Conclusion: I should say something to show my support in order to keep this friendship ‚Üí ‚ÄúUh, I hope you feel better.‚Äù</p>

        <p class="example">crying friend example:</p>
        <p class="quote">What is the reason they are crying? Ok they are crying because of X. Generally, when someone has problem X they can solve it by doing Y (heuristic statement created by Ni or Si). Therefore, it is valid for me to share Y solution with this crying person right now (Te conclusion). That will be the most helpful in this scenario.</p>

        <p class="quote">Oh, I‚Äôve been through a similar situation that led my friend to cry before. When I was sad, I wanted someone to hold me, listen to me, and give me advice. It would be a good thing to do that for my friend now because I want them to feel better.</p>

        <p class="quote">Normally, when people are hurt they just want support and a shoulder to cry on (heuristic created by Ni or Si). Therefore, it would be considered good if I hear them out and validate their emotions.</p>

        <p class="quote">‚ÄúNe is a perceiving function most related to divergent thinking. Ne users will see a physical stimulus and then try to abstractly relate that physical stimulus (or the concept of that stimulus) with something indirectly or only loosely/tangentially related. ‚Äù</p>
        <p class="example">Apple Example</p>
        <p class="quote">Apple ‚Üí fruit ‚Üí fruit loops ‚Üí Toucan Sam ‚Üí Sam-I-Am ‚Üí Eggs and Green Ham ‚Üí Dr. Seuss = Oh, do you think Dr. Seuss liked apples? / Hey you know if I turned this apple over and used two popsicles sticks and some glue, I could make this look like a lady with a dress. / You know if there are atoms in apples and atoms in celery, do you think you can rearrange the atoms in celery to make an apple?</p>
        </p>
        <p class="largeParagraph">
        <p class="quote">‚ÄúNi focuses on taking in multiple data points/physical stimuli in reality (Se) and finds one underlying pattern, concept, or answer that relates them all. These underlying patterns then become heuristics/rules of thumb that are then used to explain and predict the physical world.‚Äù</p>
        <p class="example">Apple example</p>
        <p class="quote">The concept of an apple is *usually* associated with knowledge and sin. / I see that the apple is on the teacher‚Äôs desk (data point/stimuli), I know there‚Äôs a test coming up next week (data point), there‚Äôs a sign on the wall that says bonus points are available on the test (data point/stimuli), I‚Äôm overhearing right now that teacher is known to like apples (data point/stimuli), Sarah the student kind of smells like apples (data point/stimuli) ‚Üí Sarah most likely brought in the apple to win the teacher‚Äôs favor and get extra credit on the upcoming test (answer/underlying pattern). I‚Äôll keep in mind from now on that people can try to provide gifts to win someone‚Äôs favor and get something in return from them (underlying pattern/heuristic).</p>

        <p class="largeParagraph">
        <p class="quote">‚ÄúSe take reality for what it is without adding any abstract meaning to it. It is a perception function where you use your 5 senses (e.g. sight, taste, touch, hear, smell) to sense the environment.‚Äù</p>
        <p class="example">crying friend example</p>
        <p class="quote">This apple is red, it‚Äôs shiny, it has a bunch of dots on it, it tastes good, and it smells good. When I bite into it, it makes this crunchy sound.</p>
        </p>
        <p class="largeParagraph">
        <p class="quote">‚ÄúSi is a perceiving function in which something (e.g. a physical stimulus like an apple) triggers your episodic memory. Stimulating one or more of your 5 senses can transport you back to a time you had a similar experience‚Äù</p>
        <p class="example">crying friend example</p>
        <p class="quote">This apple reminds me of the time I went apple picking with my dad. It reminds me of when I baked an apple pie with my grandma./ Oh, this apple looks a little different from all the apples I‚Äôve had thus far. Something is off about it.</p>
