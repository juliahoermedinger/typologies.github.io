        <p class="example">crying friend example:</p>
        <p class="quote">What is the reason they are crying? Ok they are crying because of X. Generally, when someone has problem X they can solve it by doing Y (heuristic statement created by Ni or Si). Therefore, it is valid for me to share Y solution with this crying person right now (Te conclusion). That will be the most helpful in this scenario.</p>

        <p class="example">crying friend example</p>
        <p class="quote">Oh, I‚Äôve been through a similar situation that led my friend to cry before. When I was sad, I wanted someone to hold me, listen to me, and give me advice. It would be a good thing to do that for my friend now because I want them to feel better.</p>

        <p class="quote">Normally, when people are hurt they just want support and a shoulder to cry on (heuristic created by Ni or Si). Therefore, it would be considered good if I hear them out and validate their emotions.</p>
